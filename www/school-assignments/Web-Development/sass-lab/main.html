    <h1>Music Genres</h1>
    <p>This page discusses six music genres. It will cover topics such as the genre's nature, origins, and historical background.</p>

    <div class="genre">
        <h3>Pop Music</h3>
        <p>The main medium of pop music is the song, often between two and a half and three and a half minutes
            in length, generally marked by a consistent and noticeable rhythmic element, a mainstream style and
            a simple traditional structure. The structure of many popular songs is that of a verse and a chorus,
            the chorus serving as the portion of the track that is designed to stick in the ear through simple
            repetition both musically and lyrically. The chorus is often where the music builds towards and is
            often preceded by "<i>the drop</i>" where the bass and drum parts "<i>drop out</i>". Common variants include the
            verse-chorus form and the thirty-two-bar form, with a focus on melodies and catchy hooks, and a
            chorus that contrasts melodically, rhythmically and harmonically with the verse. The beat and the
            melodies tend to be simple, with limited harmonic accompaniment. The lyrics of modern pop songs
            typically focus on simple themes- often love and romantic relationships- although there are notable
            exceptions.</p>

        <h3>Korean Pop</h3>
        <p>Although K-pop generally refers to South Korean popular music and the associated industry, some
            consider it to be an all-encompassing genre exhibiting a wide spectrum of musical and visual elements.
            The French Institut national de l'audiovisuel defines K-pop as a "fusion of synthesized music, sharp
            dance routines and fashionable, colorful outfits." Songs typically consist of one or a mixture of pop,
            rock, hip hop, R&B, and electronic music genres.</p>

        <h3>Chinese Pop</h3>
        <p>中文流行音樂，又名漢語流行音樂、華語流行音樂，是一個廣義的音樂類型，泛指所有來自中國大陸、香港、臺灣的歌手所演唱的中文音樂，
            有時也包括新加坡、馬來西亞等中文使用人數較多的國家和地區的歌手所演唱的中文音樂，其中又以臺灣的流行音樂最為普遍。
            中文流行音樂是一個涵蓋性術語，不僅包括中文流行音樂，有時也包括中文節奏藍調、中文民謠、中文搖滾樂、中文嘻哈音樂和中文氛圍音樂。
            中文流行音樂按照漢語方言劃分大致可分為三個子類別：國語流行音樂、粵語流行音樂、臺語流行音樂。其中「華語流行音樂」可以是
            「中文流行音樂」的別稱或專指「國語流行音樂」。華語本來與漢語、中文同義，現在有些地區則狹義化成官話的意思。
            而臺語流行音樂曾受日本演歌的強烈影響，但如今已經重新匯入中文流行音樂大框架，並已經有緊密朝向華語流行音樂發展的趨勢。
            中文流行音樂已經被視作一個改變觀點與意識形成的領導性傳播工具，專注文化、道德、政治重要性問題。在幾十年前的中國大陸，
            流行音樂成為表達這個國家突發具有再造文化特徵的社會變化的看法的重要工具。然而, 1966年至1976年的文化大革命嚴重影響了中國大陸的經濟和文化。
            在過去的50年, 中國大陸發生了密集的政治上和經濟上的變化, 從計劃經濟到社會主義市場經濟的變化促進了中國大陸的流行音樂在共產主義意識形態之下的形成。
            因此, 因為政治體系和文化、社會價值觀的不同, 中國大陸的流行音樂與西方國家的流行音樂存在很大的差異。</p>

        <h3>Japanese Pop</h3>
        <p>The origin of modern J-pop is said to be Japanese-language rock music inspired by the likes of The Beatles.
            Unlike the Japanese music genre called kayōkyoku, J-pop uses a special kind of pronunciation, which is
            similar to that of English. One notable singer to do so is Keisuke Kuwata, who pronounced the Japanese word
            karada as kyerada. Additionally, unlike Western music, the major second was usually not used in Japanese music,
            except art music, before rock music became popular in Japan. When the Group Sounds genre, which was inspired by
            Western rock, became popular, Japanese pop music adopted the major second, which was used in the final sounds of
            The Beatles' song "<i>I Want to Hold Your Hand</i>" and The Rolling Stones' song "<i>Satisfaction</i>". Although Japanese pop
            music changed from music based on Japanese pentatonic scale and distortional tetrachord to the more occidental
            music over time, music that drew from the traditional Japanese singing style remained popular.</p>

        <h3>Arabic Pop</h3>
        <p>Arabic pop is mainly produced and originated in Cairo, Egypt; with Beirut, Lebanon, as a secondary center. It
            is an outgrowth of the Arabic film industry, also predominantly located in Cairo. Since 2000, various locations
            in the Gulf countries have been producing Khaleeji pop music. The primary style is a genre that synthetically combines
            pop melodies with elements of different Arabic regional styles, called ughniyah  or in English "<i>song</i>". It uses wide
            variety of instruments, including electric guitars or electronic keyboards, as well as traditional Middle Eastern
            instruments like the oud, darbukka or qanun and many more. Another characteristic aspect of Arabic pop is the overall
            tone and mood of the songs. The majority of the songs are in a minor key, and the lyrics tend to focus on longing,
            melancholy, strife, and generally love issues.</p>

        <h3>Vietnamese Pop</h3>
        <p>During the 1970s, V-pop was limited to Nhạc trẻ Sài Gòn  or Kích động nhạc. After 1975, the name nhạc trẻ, which encompasses
            vibrant, fun folk songs that were banned by the government at the time. But the development in line with Vietnamese pop music
            comes from Hanoi and Haiphong. The artists in these two places have been formally trained in the national conservatory school.
            In the 1990s, the phrase Nhạc nhẹ  appeared when Vietnam was opening up to the world. Nhạc trẻ  was used in the early 2000s.
            The phrase V-Pop was created by artists from the North, including Hanoi.</p>
