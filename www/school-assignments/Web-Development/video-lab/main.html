        Musk has faced some controversy as a result of his use of the platform. In August 2018, he claimed in a tweet that
        he was taking Tesla private at $420 per share, a joking reference to marijuana. An SEC investigation concluded that
        the tweets had no basis in fact and hurt investors, resulting in separate fines to Musk and Tesla of $20 million each.
        The settlement also included a clause that Musk would have legal counsel approve tweets about Tesla in advance. In
        2022 he was also sued by Tesla shareholders over the tweet. Musk maintains that the joke was "worth it". In 2020 a
        tweet by Musk stating that "Tesla stock price is too high" reduced the company's value by $14 billion. Musk encountered
        further troubles in 2021, when he tweeted a poll about whether to sell 10% of his stock in the company, before doing so.
        This resulted in an SEC insider trading investigation into Musk and his brother Kimbal, relating to whether Musk told
        his brother in advance that he would tweet the poll.[233] Other points of controversy have included his tweets about
        cryptocurrency such as Dogecoin and Ethereum, which have caused their values to fluctuate, as well as tweets downplaying
        the severity of COVID-19 and criticizing lockdowns, including one comparing Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to
        Hitler over vaccine mandates.
